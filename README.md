# fundamentals-project

## Project Plan
Estimate 20 Hours
2 commits per week + 
	20/30 commits
	What’s a reasonable size commit
	Fix all typos and do one commit

1.	Create Repository - 30th September - Done
2.	Description – 18th October
a.	Create Jupyter Notebook
b.	Short & sweet description of what is in the dataset
i.	What are the variables about
ii.	What do the variables look like
iii.	What is the average tip, the biggest tip, the smallest tip
iv.	Is the average tip a typical tip (ie the mode?) or the average of mix of high & low tips
c.	Use Descriptive Statistics ie summary statistics & plots
3.	Regression - 5th November
a.	Prove that there is a relationship between the total bill and the tip size, using data analytics tech
b.	Be able to predict what tip would be given for a set spend, e.g. 1000$ -
c.	Explain what regression is / what it is used for ….

4.	Analyse – 29th November
Analyse the Relationships BETWEEN THE VARIABLEs
a.	E.g Analyse relationship between pairs/triples of variables 
i.	Be careful that while some relationships appear to have relationship ie when one goes up the other goes down etc, in fact this may not be 
b.	Or select a subset and analyse those
c.	Looking for insights
i.	Pick out something interesting & show Ian that

Summary
1.	Put introduction at start, conclusion at end and join them together in the middle.
 
# About ProgDA-Assignment
This repository contains my submission for Assignment 2019 for Programming for Data Analysis course. The assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python 3. I have created a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pcaulfie/fundamentals-project/blob/master/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of six of the distributions provided for in the package.

## Problem statement
There are four distinct tasks carried out in my Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and  “Permutations” functions.
4. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
5. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudo-random numbers.

## Installation

- I recommend that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of python which contains all the libraries used, as well an instance of Jupyter notebook.
