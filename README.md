# About Fundamentals-Project
This repository contains my submission for Assessment 2019, Fundamentals of Data Analysis course. This assessment consists of my Exploratory Data Analysis of the well known tips dataset using the Python packages, pandas, scikitlearn, seaborn and jupyter. 

I have created a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pcaulfie/fundamentals-project/blob/master/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) to present my work, where I present insights into the dataset.

## Overview of My Project
There are five distinct tasks carried out in my Jupyter notebook.

1. Data Collection
* Brief give a description of what is in the dataset, I outline the steps taken to loading the dataset and I describe what the variables look like.
2. Data Cleaning
* I check for missing data amd take a closer look at the dataset to see if there was anything unusual.
3. Data Preprocessing
* I outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* I conducted two methods of EDA; descriptive statistics and data visualization. 
* Descriptive Statistics - average tip, the biggest tip, the smallest tip. I discuss whether the average tip is a typical value or not. I investigate any interesting results, by exploring subsets of the data.
* Data Visualization - I employed a number of data visualization techniques, ranging from simple 1 dimensional plots such as histograms, 2 dimensional scatter plot up to 3 dimensional scatterplots & bubble charts to analyse univariate and multivariate relationships
5. Linear Regression
* I explain what regression is and what it is used for.
* I demonstrate that that there is a relationship between the total bill and the tip size using Simple Linear Regression. 
* I predict what tip would be given for a set spend, e.g. 1000$ -
6. Conclusions
