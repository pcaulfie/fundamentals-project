# About Fundamentals-Project

This repository contains my submission for Assessment 2019, Fundamentals of Data Analysis course. This project consists of my Exploratory Data Analysis of the well-known Tips dataset using the Python packages, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn and Jupyter.

I have created a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pcaulfie/fundamentals-project/blob/master/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) to present my work. The objective of my exploratory data analysis of the dataset is as follows:
* present insights into the dataset.
* uncover the underlying data structure;
* extract important variables;
* detect outliers and anomalies in the data;
* test underlying assumptions;
* develop a linear regression model.

## Overview of My Project
There are five distinct tasks carried out in my Jupyter notebook.

1. Data Collection
* I give a brief description of what is in the dataset, I outline the steps taken to load the dataset and I describe what the variables look like.
2. Data Cleaning
* I check for missing data and take a closer look at the dataset to check for outliers or other anomalies.
3. Data Preprocessing
* I outline the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* I conducted two methods of EDA; descriptive statistics and data visualization. 
* Descriptive Statistics - I calculate summary statistics such as average tip, the biggest tip, the smallest tip. I discuss whether the average tip is a typical value or not. I investigate any interesting results, by exploring subsets of the data.
* Data Visualization - I employed a number of data visualization techniques, ranging from simple 1-dimensional plots such as histograms, 2-dimensional scatter plot up to 3-dimensional scatterplots & bubble charts to analyse univariate and multivariate relationships.
5. Linear Regression
* I explain what regression is and what it is used for. 
* I investigate if there is a relationship between the total bill and tip size using Simple Linear Regression. 
* I predict what tip would be given for a set spend, i.e. 100$.

## Installation

- I recommend that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of python which contains all the libraries used, as well an instance of Jupyter notebook.
